Rounded Content View
====================

Rounded content view for Mac OS X

It's also possible to alter the titlebar gradient color. Actually that's possible becuase we're using textured window here and as a bonus get this weird but cool effect. In order to make it a little bit whitish and flat you need to change the `ContentBorderThickness`, the best way to do this is to set `autorecalculatesContentBorderThicknessForEdge` property to `YES`.

```objectivec
[[self window] setAutorecalculatesContentBorderThickness:YES forEdge:NSMaxYEdge];
```
